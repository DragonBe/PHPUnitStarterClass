# PHPUnit Starter Class

PHPUnit Starter Class aims to teach step-by-step how to write unit tests for [PHP](http://php.net) applications using [PHPUnit](http://phpunit.de).

The idea to start this class was after reading [a blog article](https://blog.engineyard.com/2013/a-conversation-about-testing-in-php) which was a conversation between Ed Finkler and Chris Hartjes about how difficult it was for people to get started with unit testing and using PHPUnit correctly.

You're free to join the conversation and add examples on how to test certain things. The goal is to collect as many examples, tutorials and best practices so everyone wanting to learn how to start unit testing can find their information here.
